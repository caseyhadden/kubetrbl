Can we implement https://learnk8s.io/a/troubleshooting-kubernetes.pdf?

This remains a massive WIP. Currently, it only implements the flow down the
left side of the chart, and only through the port-forward check. The code is
also very much in a straight line without much organization around it. IOW,
lots may change.
